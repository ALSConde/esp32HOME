# ESP32HOME

ESP32Home is a project to create a fully functional home automation system using ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers. It is based on the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) project, but with a focus on the ESP32.

This project is in design phase, and is not yet ready for use, but is projected to be useful for multiple home automation tasks.
